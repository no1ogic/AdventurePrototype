A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: 
-There are multiple scenes based on AdventureScene: Classroom, Hall, Bathroom, Cafeteria, Kitchen, Closet
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
-There are multiple scenes not based on AdventureScene: Trans1, Trans2, Ending1, Ending2
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Simpleslide helps simplify the animations for doors and exit areas of levels.
    - Enhancement 2: easyfade aids in the simplifaction of fading animations for interactable items.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: 
-There are multiple locations in the game world: Classroom, Hallway, Bathroom, Cafeteria, Kitchen, Closet
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: 
-There are multiple interactive objects in most scenes, the classroom has a clickable desk and symbol, the hallway has a locker with notes in it, the bathroom has a small challenge to get out etc.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: 
-Many if not all objects have pointerover messages.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: 
-Most objects with pointerover messages have pointerdown effects as well.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: 
-Most interactive items that have something inside have an animation, hence the enhancements.
